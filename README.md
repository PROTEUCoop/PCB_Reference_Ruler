PCB Ruler
========
During PCB designs a problem that I found was to constantly check for actual SMD package sizes. In the board layout the parts may look big and easy to solder but having an actual package footprint will tell you how it looks like on an actual board. Inspired by the Adafruit PCB Ruler. (https://www.adafruit.com/products/1554) I designed a PCB ruler with electronics references that I found useful (some in common with the PCB Ruler from Adafruit). 

In an attempt to get my Mechatronics 2016 class more involved and interested I decided to add our class logo and some of our favourite professors on one other side. 

References include:
-------------------
-	Trace widths (imperial and metric)
-	SMD resistor and capacitor packages: 0603, 0805, 1206, 2010 etc.
-	SOT packages: SOT223, SOT23-6, SOT89, SOT23
-	Other packages including: SO08, SO14, TQFP32, CLV-0810, DPAK etc.
-	Wire gauges
-	Negative feedback op-amp
-	N-channel, p-channel MOSFET and TRIAC
-	Resistor colour code
